# AMADEUS

Beautiful, approachable, and scalable multi-part widget orchestra. Amadeus is a
metaphor-heavy cloud work-doer. Original intent is to speed up reporting on
large, disconnected data-sets by promoting guided, asynchronous processing with
an unmanaged collection of worker nodes. Thoughts on what can be done to expand
on the original intent has manifested, as per norm, to muddle the mixture.

Despite possible deviations the current MVP of Amadeus only knows about data
and the processes that can be run on it -- quickly.

>> Gotta go fast
